# Sign Up Page

**Version 1.0.0**

A simple project to practice creating a static HTML page with a basic form.

---

## Goals: 

* To work from a design and try to reproduce it accurately with HTML and CSS.
* To make the page responsive for various desktop/laptop screen sizes (I'm not going to worry too much about how this looks on mobile devices).

## Design Template:
